# 📊 Power Query Excel Project: Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Merging

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project demonstrates **practical data preparation in Excel using Power Query** through:

1️⃣ **Pizza Sales Dataset** – Cleaning and transforming messy raw sales data for analysis.

2️⃣ **Maven Market Sales Dataset** – Merging multi-year transaction data into a unified analysis-ready dataset.

Both projects produce **final cleaned datasets** in structured Excel files ready for PivotTable, Power Pivot, or dashboard analysis.

## 1️⃣ Pizza Sales Dataset: Cleaning & Transformation

### 📂 Files:

* [`data cleaning and preprocessing - power query.xlsx`](pizza%20sales/data%20cleaning%20and%20preprocessing%20-%20power%20query.xlsx) (**✅ Final cleaned dataset**)
* [`order_details.csv`](pizza%20sales/order_details.csv)
* [`orders.csv`](pizza%20sales/orders.csv)
* [`pizza_types.csv`](pizza%20sales/pizza_types.csv)

### 🛠️ What Was Done:

* Imported multiple CSV files into Power Query.
* Filtered irrelevant and incomplete rows.
* Removed unnecessary columns.
* Standardized and corrected data types (dates, numbers, text).
* Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
* Added calculated columns for enhanced analysis (e.g., extracting year, month).
* Sorted and structured data, then loaded to the **final output Excel file**.

## 2️⃣ Maven Market Sales Dataset: Merging Multi-Year Data

### 📂 Files:

* [`dataset merge - power query.xlsx`](market_sales/dataset%20merge%20-%20power%20query.xlsx) (**✅ Final merged dataset**)
* [`MavenMarket_Transactions_1997.csv`](market_sales/MavenMarket_Transactions_1997.csv)
* [`MavenMarket_Transactions_1998.csv`](market_sales/MavenMarket_Transactions_1998.csv)

### 🛠️ What Was Done:

* Imported 1997 and 1998 transaction data into Power Query.
* Cleaned and standardized column names and data types.
* Appended both datasets to create a single unified dataset.
* Verified data integrity, removed duplicates, and ensured consistency.
* Loaded the consolidated dataset into the **final output Excel file** for analysis.
