Power Query – Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Merging Project

### **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates **practical data cleaning, transformation, and merging using Power Query in Excel** across two structured tasks:

1️⃣ **Cleaning and transforming a pizza sales dataset**
2️⃣ **Merging sales transaction datasets for consolidated analysis**

---

### **Project Structure**

#### **1️⃣ Pizza Sales Dataset (Cleaning and Transformation)**

**Location:**
`data cleaning and preprocessing - power...` along with `pizzas`, `pizza_types`, `orders`, `order_details`

**What was done:**
✅ Imported multiple raw Excel datasets into Power Query.
✅ Removed unnecessary columns and filtered irrelevant rows.
✅ Changed data types for consistency (dates, numbers).
✅ Inserted custom columns for derived fields (e.g., extracting month/year).
✅ Cleaned column names and standardized formatting.
✅ Sorted and structured data for analysis-ready output.
✅ Loaded cleaned data for easy PivotTable/Power Pivot analysis.

---

#### **2️⃣ Maven Market Sales Dataset (Merging)**

**Location:**
`dataset merge - power query` along with `MavenMarket_Transactions_1997`, `MavenMarket_Transactions_1998`

**What was done:**
✅ Imported 1997 and 1998 transaction datasets into Power Query.
✅ Cleaned column names for consistency before merging.
✅ Used **Append Queries** in Power Query to merge the two datasets into a single consolidated dataset.
✅ Verified and removed duplicates post-merge.
✅ Ensured consistent data types across merged columns.
✅ Loaded the merged dataset into Excel for seamless analysis.

---

### **Tools Used**

✅ **Power Query (Get & Transform Data in Excel)** for systematic cleaning, transformation, and merging.
✅ **Excel** for reviewing, verifying, and preparing data for analysis.

### **Skills Practiced**

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
✅ Column management and filtering
✅ Data type handling and transformations
✅ Dataset merging using Power Query
✅ Preparing structured datasets for analysis

### **Next Steps**

🔹 Use the cleaned pizza sales dataset for sales trend analysis, product performance, and customer order patterns.
🔹 Analyze the consolidated Maven Market sales data to identify yearly sales patterns, top products, and regional performance.
🔹 Practice advanced Power Query transformations (grouping, unpivoting, conditional logic) for future projects.
🔹 Integrate these cleaned datasets with **Power Pivot** for advanced DAX-based analysis and interactive dashboards.
